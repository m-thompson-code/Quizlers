# Quizlers
So I should start with a flex box as a container in the center of the screen, and a countdown timer in the right top corner as well as high scores tab in left top corner that they can log in their intials and diff scores. I can just keep them seperate in the header bit in my code or make an additional grid (not sure whats better :///) 
Are the questions persented in cards? like i could find in bootstrap or something? is that allowed... 
well in the main body I will need a Start Quiz button this will start a coutdown timer once clicked, as well as the first question of the quiz.
once answered there will be a new question 5 times as long as answered correctly - if answered incorrectly the time is subtracted from the clock.
Once all answers have been completed or countdown is reaches 0  the game will end.
then the user will have to save the initials and score to the top right corner.
